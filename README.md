# 1. when the user open the page, two prompts pop-up,
## the first asks for his name and the second is for the gender.
## in order to fill the custom greeting 


# 2. Once the Page is loaded the user will be able to see a button 
## on the top right corner of the big box in skyblue esh.
## If he clicks the button the game will start and he will be asked 
## seven questions, each in a single prompt.

# 3. The user will have 4 attempts on question number 6 which is the number guessing 
## question, also he will have 6 chances on question 7 to guess a TVShow that I've watched.
## If he consumed all his attempts and chances on these questions an alert will apear to 
## notify him that he have no more attempts.

# 4. The ecorrect answers will appear beside its questions in the box in green esh color 
## and the wrong answers will appear in red esh color.
## His score will be calculated and shown in the box footer.

# 5. ofter the user finish the game a list of my TVShows list will apear as long with a box footer
## that shows the user's score out of 14, the text on the button will change from 'Start' to
## 'Try again'.
